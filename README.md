RaspberryPiCamera
=================
You'll need to install the Raspi-Cam-Interface ( http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=63276). After that you'll need to add the html,js and php files into var/www. The python file can be put anywhere on the pi, but need to be executed in order to work.
